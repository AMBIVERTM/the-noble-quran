                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Holy Quran is the sacred book of the Muslims. This is my favourite book. The word "Quran" means the "Reading". 
                                It is a book not written by human being. It was sent for Man's guidance by Allah Almighty through our Last Prophet (ï·º). Hazrat Gabriel 
                                was used to carrying the message of God. It is the book widely read in the world.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Holy Quran is divided into 30 'Paras' and 114 'Surahs'. Each Surah contains a different number of verses. 
                                Out of 114 'Surahs' 92 were revealed at Makkah and 22 at Madinah. The Holly Quran contains 6,616 verses, 77, 934 words and 3, 23, 760 letters 
                                of Arabic. The opening chapter of the book is regarded with special reverence by the Muslims. It is called 'Surah Fateh'. It contains seven verses. We recite it in our prayers.</p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">What is the language that was revealed to the Qur'an?</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"></p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The holy Quran is written in Arabic which is a very forceful language. Its style is highly impressive and appealing. It
                                 is so perfect and lofty that neither men nor jinn can produce a single verse similar to it. The book was not sent for the Arabs alone, 
                                 but for the whole world without distinction of color, creed, or caste. The book is our best guide. It is full of wisdom, truth, facts, 
                                 philosophy, beauty, grace and love. This book covers all the aspects of life and gives guidance on all topics. It is a divine sacred 
                                 book for the spiritual, social and personal guidance of human being.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Holy Quran is an everlasting book. Allah has declared in the Holy Book that it is He Who is responsible for its 
                                safety. This is why no one has succeeded as yet to alter even the smaller verse of the Holy Book. It was compiled during the caliphate 
                                of Hazrat Usman (R.A) who was interested in its compilation. The 'Araabs' and other signs were put on the Holy Book by the two disciples 
                                of Hazrat Ali (R.A) under his guidance.</p>

                                        Many Muslims learn this voluminous book by heart. They are called Hafiz-e-Quran. This is a miracle of this book.
